# Conceptualize

1. Introduction

Over the past year and a half whilst I have been developing programs and application
concepts, many people have come to me asking if I can build programs and apps for
them. This has led me to this, ‘Conceptualize’, a site which allows you to sell your ideas
directly to software companies, both large and small. Plenty of people have ground
breaking ideas, however do not know where to start, especially the ones with families
who cannot risk dropping their jobs and developing a program which might come off.
Conceptualize connects you to a range of companies which will let you be bought
outright or if negotiate will let you work alongside them to further develop the program
in a joint venture. A contract at the beginning of each program is developed so
everyone can know their splits and we will point you in the direction of lawyers in the
area.
