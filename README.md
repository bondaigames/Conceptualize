# Conceptualize

1. Introduction

- Over the past year and a half whilst I have been developing programs and application
concepts, many people have come to me asking if I can build programs and apps for
them. This has led me to this, ‘Conceptualize’, a site which allows you to sell your ideas
directly to software companies, both large and small. Plenty of people have ground
breaking ideas, however do not know where to start, especially the ones with families
who cannot risk dropping their jobs and developing a program which might come off.
Conceptualize connects you to a range of companies which will let you be bought
outright or if negotiate will let you work alongside them to further develop the program
in a joint venture. A contract at the beginning of each program is developed so
everyone can know their splits and we will point you in the direction of lawyers in the
area.

2. Purpose & Users Characteristics
- The world has an untapped amount of ideas from people who just don’t know where to
go start developing them, unless you have techy friends or have connections, most ideas
you normally have to work at and most people aren’t prepare to sacrifice like that. This
site allows people to post their ideas and earn some money for them, depending on
what exactly happens through the transaction.

- Anyone from 10 through to 100 will be able to submit ideas to the site, however, to
submit them there is a process. First the SRS document must be completely filled out, a
profile created and then the document can be uploaded and shared with everyone.
Everyone benefits from it too, the buyer gets to choose if the idea will be good for them
and will be beneficial for the seller too because they are getting paid for something they
have thought up and then put down on paper. This allows the massively complex ideas
to be sold off to companies who can make it happen, this will ensure global progress.

    There are 2 selling methods which each buyer and seller would work through and each
situation would be different.

    - Selling method 1: buyer (developer/development Company) buys the idea off the seller
outright. All previous rights held by the seller are forfeited and a lump sum is paid by the
buyer to the seller.

    - Selling method 2: buyer and seller reach an agreement to continue development
together as a joint venture. In these cases a contract between both parties is written up.
The buyer and seller will accept they only own 50% and also accepts that neither on
gets paid unless the program turns a profit or is sold and bought out by someone.
